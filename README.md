Time Based Modal Workshop: Individual Homework

  First page has a timed modal show up that asks you to enter email and check a box to agree to terms. 
  Doing both of these will load a new page in a new tab. 
  The 'email,' that you submitted on the previous page, will be displyed in another timed modal on this page as well.
  On this second page there is also a set interval adding text to the background every 1/3 of a second.
