# Time-Based-Modal

  First page has a timed modal show up that asks you to enter email and check a box to agree to terms.  
  Doing both of these will load a new page in a new tab.  
  The name, that you submitted on the previous page, will be displyed in another timed modal on this page as well.  
  On this second page there is also a set interval adding text to the background every 1/3 of a second.
